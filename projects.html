<p>
Cody's head's main structure comprised of aluminum extrusion when I joined the club; the head was massive and aesthetically displeasing w.r.t. Anas (Club CEOs) vision.
Cody was supposed to mimic Samsung's Otto and have smooth lines. This lead to an overhaul of the existing design and instead working towards an entirely 3D printed head.

<p>
My first task when I joined Nanostride was to surface model an "aesthetically pleasing" shell that would sit over Cody's Aluminum skull.
As can be seen in the above photos multiple iterations of shells were modelled, in order to encompass the Aluminum structure. Each row
of images displays successive model iterations; we see Cody evolving from a neanderthal to a modern day homo sapien.
</p>
<div id="imggrp">
<img loading="lazy" id="rep" src="images/head (surface)/IMG-20240115-WA0010.jpg" >
</div>
<p>
Cody is ~6 ft tall; the size of the shell designed was constrained by the size of the extrusion-frame. 
The final skull + head shell looked extremely disproportionate with respect to the rest of Cody.
The components housed by the extrusion-frame were much lighter than the frame;
hence the design team set out to design a 3D printable version of the head with a much smaller volume.
The main size constraint in the head now was the large screen that acts as Cody's eyes and the rest of the head would be modelled to mimic human proportions.</p>

This picture gives only half the picture; greater volume savings were also obtained by having more natural curves
at the rear and front of Cody's skull.
</p>

<div id="imggrp">
<img loading="lazy" id="xllpic" src="images/head+mounts.png" >
</div>
<p>
Once the overall curvature was satisfacory; mounts were designed to pickup the screen, 
mic, camera, neck, sensors, and multiple slices of the head. Cody's face was also sliced from the rest of the body. 
</p>

<div id="imggrp">

<p>
Here are renders of the head and a physical print of Cody_head_v1 and the mounts.
These mounts had small extrusion that press fit into holes in the head and an adhesive was used to secure them.
</p>

<p>
The new slice for the face is flatter and allows for the larger piece to be printed without further segmentation on our Bambu printer.
Quality of life updates made to all mounts inside; new mount for Raspberry Pi. Any holes on the head were filled up; the mounts are now printed with the head.

Here are some renders of what the shell looked like when I joined Nanostride. This was when Cody had an additional degree of freedom at its waist using a turntable bearing.
We either make humanoid legs or we let Cody be a front-desk assistant as intended; no one is seeing Cody's hips. All in or no in

<p>
The basic concept for the parametric design of the slew-bearing was adopted from this awesome video; we just modified the fixed and mobile rings to work with our neck mechanism.

Exploded layout of all parts in slew-stepper actuator sub-assembly; driven by a 1:1 gear on the stepper. We also ordered a planetary gearbox from AliExpress with a 1:13.76 reduction; in the first iteration we 3D printed the gearbox but it was super loud.</p>

Left-Right (v1 to v4) are evolutions of the servo plates through multiple testing phases. V1 was never prototyped; instead was used to establish the various link lengths and positions.
<br> <br>
V2 includes the addition of stronger mounts to the entire structure but shows a major weakpoint; the top of the central axis where the load bearing u-joint sits has layer lines parallel to the forces and sheared the first time we tested it. And also a lack of ribs for the servo mounts.
<br> <br>
In V3 the central shaft was printed separately with layer lines perpendicular to the force for testing purposes. Now that structurally a base design was found; the aesthetic was cleaned up and a housing for u-joint added for additional support in V4.

<!-- ESP-32 Cam --><div id="imggrp"><u><h3 id="esp32">esp32-cam for printer</h3></u></div>
<p>My 3D printer is down in my basement, I also made the noob mistake of ordering two rolls of ABS for my first 3D printing adventures; in the beginning large parts would warp and fail like crazy. This project was just so that I could remotely monitor my prints from my room on the first floor.
<br><br><b>Future project upgrades:</b> Octo4a on old S7 edge or Video stream over web server so that I can access it globally.
</p>
<p>
For a stable video stream it is recommended to run the ESP32-CAM off of 5V; initially I was going to run them off batteries. But then I remembered something Augusto was doing for Cody; most of Cody's component run using the same 24V 20A DC PSU that my 3D printer came with.
To 'step-down' the DC voltage to power smaller components he used a buck converter. I order a 5V output buck converter to power the ESP32-CAM.
</p>
<div id="imggrp">
<img loading="lazy" id="xlpic" src="images/esp32cam/Xd8D6Uw.png" >
</div>
<p>
To program the ESP32-CAM board, it came with an ESP32-CAM-MB board. This board was very unreliable for me and created unnecessary problems that were hard for me tackle given my inexperience with electronics.
Instead I ordered a USB-TTL adapter; and the programming was smooth sailing from there. The sample code for the ESP32/Video works flawlessly for our use case.

<!-- Thermoelectric Car --><div id="imggrp"><u><h3 id="tec">thermoelectric car</h3></u></div>
<p>
This was a fun project for one of my university courses; would have done much more testing and prototyping if I wasn't enrolled in 15 credits that semester.
<br><br><b>Project statement:</b> Make a vehicle powered by a thermoelectric generator (Peltier device) that runs of a heat source, must run 1m on a flat surface. Bonus marks if it climbs the 1m over the 20 degree incline.
<br><br> The peltier used was a TEC-40-39-127, a heatsink was used to carry heat way from the peltier, a regular DC geared motor was used to drive the rear wheels with a 1:10 reduction.
</p>

<div id="imggrp">
<img loading="lazy" id="xlpic" src="images/tec/tec.jpg" >
</div>
<p>
In iteration 1 above, we were able to obtain ~1.3V consistently but it required pushing the icepack/cold sink with the heatsink. Copper sheet and thermal paste were used as inetrface between peltier and any heating / cooling element.
The blue thread did not provide ample pressure and a drop off in voltage was observed once we let go. The housing was 3D printed.
</p>

<div id="imggrp">
<img loading="lazy" id="xlpic" src="images/tec/tec2.jpg" >
</div>
<p>
In iteration 2 above, peltier slid in front of the housing and we had a cardboard chassis. The pink part acts as cold reservoir for the cold side of the peltier. But I wasn't able to waterproof the design and had to move away from it.
</p>

<div id="imggrp">
<img loading="lazy" id="xlpic" src="images/tec/WhatsApp Image 2023-11-20 at 00.56.04_105a0663.jpg" >
</div>
<p>
In iteration 3 above, I found a small aluminum box at home in, i cut a square hole to the size of the peltier and hot glued the peltier to the cold reservoir, this design was the most leak proof and kept the peltier's cold side ice cold. The peltier got so called that it took a whole minute for the candle to create a temperature differential across the peltier now. Xd8D6Uw
A constant 1.6V was obtained from this setup once the max differential was attained.

        <blockquote>
        <p>An exercise into a more accessible actuator design for the modified Solo12</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Solo12 has a very compact and lightweight design which imposes dimensional constraints on the choice of drive. All joints, except the knee, can be directly driven, reducing the need to source AT3 timing belts, pulleys and associated hardware.</p>
        <p>Alternative drive mechanism are explored in order to find a more accessible approach to quadruped joints i.e. in this case the cycloidal drive is fully 3D printed and only requires standard bearings.</p>
        <p>A FDM 3D printed cycloidal drive was initially designed to fit in a 5cmx5cmx5cm bounding box. At this scale, small dimensional variances introduce backlash into the cycloidal drive. To get a better understanding of the tolerances; an open cage cycloidal drive was prototyped and tested.</p>

        <p>For the next iteration of the prototype, adjustments were made in CAD as follows:
        3 sets of cycloidal disks were printed with each cycloidal profile shaving 0.1mm from the last, in addition to larger clearance tolerances; </li>
        6 shafts were printed with each diameter increasing by 0.1mm from 1.0mm to 1.5mm; </li>
        the rollers were scrapped and replaced by a cycloidal profile on the fixed housing.</li>

        <p>Having a single cycloidal disk introduces a lot of vibrations into the drive, so a general recommendation is to have a second cycloidal disk with its cam offset by 180 degrees. This in turn halves the load pin diameter! The third prototype was designed with these changes in mind.</p>

The load during testing was 2 kgs at 1.75cm from the drive&#39;s center, resulting in a torque of <code>0.34 Nm</code> which is slightly higher than the stall torques listed on the MN4004 <a href="https://store.tmotor.com/product/mn4004-kv300-motor-antigravity-type.html">BLDC website</a>. This is still ~8x lower than the maximal output torque expected from the solo12 actuator (~2.7Nm), but is closer to torque values during resting / trotting gait.</p>
        <p><strong>First, to verify the working of the drive, it was hand driven:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Then the drive was tested with a 1000 KV BLDC running at 12V:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Finally, using a drill, it was tested at high speed and the aforementioned torque:</strong></p>

        <p>After about an hour of intermittently cycling with the drill, the 3D printed discs started wearing at the profile, forming ABS powder and a lot of backlash is observed in the drive.</p>

        <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This exercise helped the mechanical team better understand the long term drawbacks of a 3D printed drive at the aforementioned scale. The cycloidal drive quickly wears down and loses alot of its favorable properties. Quick way to reduce friction in the drive would be to replace the lobes of the cycloidal profile against which the disk moves with rollers but this brings with it additional hardware costs. One could also have multiple cycloidal disks offset by smaller angles but this would keep decreasing the load pin diameter to a point where it would be impossible for the pins to be structural!</p>
        <p>Further explorations into more accessible alternatives to the dual-stage timing belt reduction will also be conducted in the near future. :)</p>
